# README

This app is just for me to test a few different search gems.
My plan is to implement each search gem on a new branch, so they have their own.
You might wonder why there are no searchkick, solr ect.
That is because I wanted to test the smaller search gems/option, and end up implementing one of them on a 5$Â droplet on digital ocean.  If its possible :)

Once I am done i'll hopefully have the following implemented:

* https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search

* https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack

* https://github.com/pat/thinking-sphinx

* https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot
